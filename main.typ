    - Joint research project, PI: Suzanne Vernon, advisor: Shad Roundy, co-adviser: Tucker Hermans. In collaboration with the Bateman Horne Center's clinical research team, we developed and managed a new data collection infrastructure.
    - The infrastructure is built on 5000+ lines of Nix, Python, Go and C++, aggregating 100+ IMUs, 20+ single-board computers, and 3+ high-performance servers. We collected terabyte-level motion data, and applied sensor fusion, motion analysis, and machine learning techniques on collected time-series data and survey data. We are planning to use our research outcome to propose to medical regulators as possible standardized diagnostic procedures and severity categorization methods for ME/CFS, Long COVID, and other related medical syndromes.
